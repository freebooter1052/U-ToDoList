Project Description
 To-Do List website that made for lazy people for working every task  one after another continously.After creating a task you can't see the cart empty ever.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
    The problem is that every one installing and using to do list applications and websites.Nobody cares about after completing one or two.So, many people skips thier tasks after completing one or two.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
    Just add next task before completing the previous task.Nobody can complete all of them if no one creating a new task.If the user completes a solution and creates the new task then the previous task will show in finished bar and created a task.So, even if a task completed ,a uncompleted task remains while not considering user's interest.
